# GameTheory-and-anxiety-

The idea behind this project is trying to simuale a math model to prove that anxiety can affect choices in a game theory clock game but 
there's another variable to keep in mind and that is: The will to win. 

What we are trying to prove (in a week so we had to hard code) is that the higher you want to win the slower your anxiety function will grow.
